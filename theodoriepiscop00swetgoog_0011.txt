PREFACE.

THE issue of this volume has been postponed in consequence
of the additional labour involved in the preparation of Ap-
pendix A. 1 trust that the delay may be justified by the'
convenience which will attend the binding up of the Inter-
preter's directly dogmatic utterances with the remains of his
Commentary on ten of the Pauline EpistleS.

I have been compelled to relinquish the hope of printing
a list of variants which Cardinal Pitra had offered to suplzily
from a third MS. os the Latin translation (cf. 1. xv, n.). The:
Cardinal-has recently written to express his regret that hue ῆς
unable to furnish the information. His withdrawal is the mort:
unfortunate, as he is not at liberty to reveal the present locality
of the MS.

Among the notices which the first volume has received
in England and in Germany I have observed but one which
offers any suggestions for the further emendation of tin:
text. These criticismS, which are from the pen os Profesfflff
J. L. Jacobi‚ have been incorporated, as far as Ι have been
able to accept them, among the additions and corrections

which follow the Commentary.
