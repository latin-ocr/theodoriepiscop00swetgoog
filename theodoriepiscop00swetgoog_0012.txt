vl PREFACE.

My acknowledgements are again due to Mr Bensly, sor having
revised'the Syriae quotations in the notes and Appendices; to
the officers and workrnen os the University Press‚ sor their

continued endeavours to bring the letter-press to perfection;

and to the Syndics ol the Press, sor the patience with which

they have borne the many delays incident to the execution

oi my task.

For mysell, the work which has occupied the leisure ol
the last seven years will have its lull reward, ii this edition
ol one of the most remarkable os ancient commentaries shall

be permitted to lighten in any way the toil ol those who are
“ engaged in the higher labour of editing and interpreting the
' Epistles os s Pan.
