AD THESSALONICENSES II.

ARGUMENTUM.

BEATUS apostolus PauluS, postquam primam ad Thessalo-
nicenses scripserat epistolam, cognouit quod quamquam aduer-
sariorum pertinacia in eadem perstiterit saeuitia, uariis tempta·
tionibus adgressa eos qui crediderant, tamen ad omnia illa aspera
quae isdem fuerant [inlata, uirtute] Dei in fide persistenteS,
superiores omni temptatione fuerint demonstrati. cognouit
uero quod a quibusdam suasi aestiment finem praesenti in·
cumbere saeculo, hocque aliqui quasi ab ipso apostolo edocti ’

of which he had received a favourable
report [c. i]; (α) guards against the error

imminent, reminding the Thessalonians
that it must be preceded by the revela-
tion of the Antichrist [c. ii]; (3) ad-
ministers· a rebuke to the indolent and
disorderly brethren who had refused to
profit by his advice’ [c. iii].—Thdt.’s
argument again closely resemblae Theo·

and the beginning of the next, sufficient
for two words of fully average length.
