FURTHER ,CITATIONS FROM THE LATIN THEODORE. 347

tells us that on one occasion Amalarius enjoyed the privilege of free
access to the books of the Imperial library¹; and it may have been there
that he formed an acquaintance with the Latin translation of Theodore.

Amalarius cites Ambrosiaster under the name of Ambrose on Rom.
xiv. 5 (Migne, P. L. 105, 1065), 1 Cor. iii. 6 (ib. 1012), xi. 8 (ib. 1104),
xi. 26 (ib. 1010), xii. 28 (ib. 1 1 19) ; and Theodore under the same name
on Phil. ii. 9 (Migne, 1009, 1225), 1 Tim. ii. 1² (ib. 987, 1175, 1242),
iii. 8 (ib. 1089, 1090), iii. 14 sq. (ib. 1084). Hence it appears probable
that in his codex of Ambrosius in epp. D. Pauli the commentarj,r nn
Romans and 1 Corinthians was entirely Ambrosiaster'5‚ and that that
on the Epistles from Philippians onwards was Theodore’s 3 but tinere
is no evidence to shew whether his ‘Ambrose ' = Theodore began with
Philippians, as in the MS. used by RabanuS‚ or with Galatiam, as in tha..-
one from which Sedulius copied.

In the commentary on 1 Tim. ii., iii. Ι have been able to give tin:
variants from Amalarius under the text. The following are the only
peculiarities I have noted in the short extract from Philippinffi.
1. p. 222, l. 19 cognoscent, 20 quia (fir quoniam [1⁰]), 25 donatur Ι
illud (for illum). P. 22 3, l. 8 - dicit.

2. Ι have found extracts from our translation also in one ns [he
letters of RabanuS, the epistle addressed to Hincmar in referente
to the case of Gotteschalk (Migne. P. L. 112, 1518 sq.). This letter
was written in A.D.· 848, or at the earliest in 847, and is therefore 1:21th
than the commentaries on S. Paul. It contains a reference to Ambro-
siaster on Eph. i. 4, 5, and citations from ‘ Ambrose' = Theodore zm
1 Tim. ii. 1 (cf. 11. pp. 86—88), 5—7 (ib. pp. 88—90); Tit. iii. 1:2-
(ib. p. 2 5 5)⁸. The first two extracts were not discovered in timc tr:-
allow of the variants being incorporated in the body of the work. They:
are as follows: 11. p. 86, l. 12 -hominibus, 13 praecepit, 21 deguerint,
22 facientes. P. 87, l. 1 illis. P. 88, 1. 5 deus (for dominus). Ρ, 31],

“dedit ei imperator copiam librorum de which find place in S. Augustine [ss-gn.
