THE FRAGMENTS OF THE PERPETUAL

EDICT OF SALVIUS JULIANUS,

collected, arranged, and annotated by BRvnN WaLKsR, Μ.Α. LLD„
Law Lecturer of St John’s college, and late Fellow of Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge. Crown 8vo., Cloth, Price bs.

“This isone of the latest, vre believe
quite the latest, of the contributions made to
legal scholarship by that revived study of
the Roman Law at Cambridge which .¹⁵ now
so marked a feature in the industrral life
of the University. . . . ln the present book
we have the fruits of the wore lund of
thorough and well-ordered study which was
brought to hear upon the notes to the Com·

mentories and the institutes. .. Hitherto
the Edict has been almost inaccessrble to
the ordinary English student, and such a
student will be interested as well as perhaps
surprised to find how abundantly the eatam
fragments illustrate and clear uplpoints which
have attracted his attention m e Commen-
taries, or the Institutes, or the Digest.''-
