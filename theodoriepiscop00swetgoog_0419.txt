“lt would be difficult to find a lecturer
better qualitied to discourse upon the prac-

oi a large experiente and oi wide observa-

and much more. As a man oi method
it isias superior to anything we have seen.
lts suggestions ol practioel means and me·
thods are very valuable; but ίι has an ele·

tone is loity; its spirit religione: its ideal oi

The volume is one σι’ great actinal valtie.
It should be in the handso every teacher,
and oi ev one preparing ior the office oi a
teaeher. t'lhern are many besides these who
will find much in ιι ιο interest and instrum
them, more especially is who have chil-

Fitch’s book covers so wide a field and
touches on so many biirning questions that
