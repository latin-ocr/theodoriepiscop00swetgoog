A SKETCH OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY FROM

THALES TO CICERO, by Jossett B. Matott, M.A.‚ Professor of
Moral Philosophy at King's college, London. Price 3s. 6d.

“ lt ntay safely be affirmed that Mt Mayor has successfully aceom lished all that he here sets
out. His arran ement is admirably methodical, his style is simple hut nervotts, his knowledge
of his subject tuh and accurate, and his analytical expositions luctd and vivid....lt is therefore a
manual which will prove of great utility to University under raduates, for whom it was pat·-
ticttlcrl p red, and also for all who stud Plato, Aristode, or other philosophers, in the
originaf. ucated readers, generally, will fud rt an admirable introduction, or epitome, of
ancient speculative thought, and ‘a key to our present ways of thinking and judging iu regard to
matters of the highest importance.' ''— rie Britrslr Maii.

''ln writing this scholarly and attractive sketch, Professor Ma or has had chiefl in view
‘undergraduates at the University or others who are cominencing³ the study of the phihisopliical
works of Cicero or Plato or Aristotie tn the ongrnal unguage: ut also hopes that tt ‘inay be
found interesting and useful by eduoeted readers generally, not merely as an introduction to the
formal history ot philosophy, butas supplying a lrey to ottr present ways of thinking sind judging
in re to matters of the highest importance.'''-Mind

‘⁸ rofessor blayor contribules to the Pitt Press Series A steret of Ana‘ent Philosophy in
which he has endeavoured to give a general view of ¹the philosoyitrhieat systema illustrated by the
{filistiim} ihffihllli'ril ditihttlssfftriittt chisiani? {histis
Politics of Aristotle: and these abstracts will be to some readers not the least useful portioris of
the book. It may be objected against his design in eneral that ancient philosoph is too vast
and too deep a subject to be dismissed in a ‘steten-that it should be left to those who will make
it a serious study. But that objectton takes no account of the large class of persons who desire
to know, in relation to sent discussions and speculationi, what famous men in the whole world
thought and wrote on t ese topics. They trave not the scholarship which would be necessary for
original examination of authorities: but they have an intelligent interest in the relations between

ancient and modern (philosophy, and need just such informatton as Professor Mayor’s sketch will

give thern.''-The uardt'cin.
